5 6
5 7 8 9
5 7 9
5 7 8 9
5 6 9
0 1 3 0 0
6 7 7 7

**Output (No Case)**
No
1 1 0 0 1

**Input Explanation**
You have n job candidates and k<=n recruiters.  The first line of input is n 
and k such that in the above example n=5 (we have 5 job candidates) and
k=5 (we have 5 job interviewers).

There are restrictions on which candidates the recruiters can interview. That
is denoted by lines 2 through (2+n).  In the above examples it is these lines:
5 6
5 7 8 9
5 7 9
5 7 8 9
5 6 9
Candidate 1 can be interviewed by recruiter 5 & 6. Candidate 2 can be
interviewed by 5, 7, 8, & 9, etc.

The second to last line denotes the total number of candidates a recruiter can
interview (their capacity):
0 1 3 0 0
Recruiter 5 can interview 0 people.  Recruiter 6 can interview 1 person.

The final line denotes the current matching which is always 1 fails to match 
the (n-1) candidate:
6 7 7 7
Candidate 1 is interviewed by recuiter 6. Candidate 2 is interviewed by 
recruiter 7.  Candidate (n+k) never has an interviewer.

**Output Explanation**
If there exists a full assignment of recruiters to candidates, the first line
will output "Yes" and the second line with output the matching.  If no possible
assignment exists, the first line with output "No" and the second line will be
a list of 1s and 0s denoting which recuiters capacities can be increase in order
to allow a full assignment.  Below is a Yes case example.
